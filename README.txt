Accessibility Challenge

The changes were made with the scope of making the page more accessible, both for users and for developers who may need to modify the code in the future.

The main changes:

- Inserting a proper page title;
- A brief change in the semantics of the elements to make them clearer and more easily identifiable;
- Significant changes in CSS, making it more objective and simplified, avoiding repeated and redundant codes;
- Inclusion of the "alt" element for images;
- Changing the order of elements in style.css, so that the same elements are in the same group.
